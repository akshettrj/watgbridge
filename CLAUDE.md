## Repo task proof loop

For substantial features, refactors, and bug fixes, use the repo-task-proof-loop workflow.

Required artifact path:
- Keep all task artifacts in `.agent/tasks/<TASK_ID>/` inside this repository.

Required sequence:
1. Freeze `.agent/tasks/<TASK_ID>/spec.md` before implementation.
2. Implement against explicit acceptance criteria (`AC1`, `AC2`, ...).
3. Create `evidence.md`, `evidence.json`, and raw artifacts.
4. Run a fresh verification pass against the current codebase and rerun checks.
5. If verification is not `PASS`, write `problems.md`, apply the smallest safe fix, and reverify.

Hard rules:
- Do not claim completion unless every acceptance criterion is `PASS`.
- Verifiers judge current code and current command results, not prior chat claims.
- Fixers should make the smallest defensible diff.

Installed workflow agents:
- `.claude/agents/task-spec-freezer.md`
- `.claude/agents/task-builder.md`
- `.claude/agents/task-verifier.md`
- `.claude/agents/task-fixer.md`

Claude Code note:
- If `init` just created or refreshed these files during a running Claude Code session, start a new Claude Code session before relying on the updated agent list.
- Use `/agents` to inspect the available agents.
- Keep this block in the root `CLAUDE.md`. If the workflow needs longer repo guidance, prefer `@path` imports or `.claude/rules/*.md` instead of expanding this block.
